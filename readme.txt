Allows your member to add a bookmarklet to their browser to easily share links in your BP community

== Description ==
BP BookMarklet allows your members to add a bookmarklet to their browser to easily share links in your BuddyPress powered community.

Members can find the bookmarklet alternatively in their profile header or in a sidebar widget if the super administrator activated it. They just need to drag it to the bookmark toolbar of their browser.
Then, while surfing on websites, they can use this bookmarklet to directly share links to the active page into the BuddyPress community.

The title, url and the selected text of the page will be included in the activity content

Since version 2.0 of the plugin, a member can automatically attach one of the image of the page to the content of the activity.

<strong>NB</strong> : Since version 2.0, this plugin requires at least BuddyPress 1.7.

This plugin is available in french and english.
